Problem:
.pyd file is a DLL(dynamic link library) file for python. The .pyd file is python-version-dependent, but the binaries available online only provides python 2.7 version.

Solution:
Build it from libftdi source and configure it according to the development environment.

Things to prepare:
1. Windows 10 64bit/32bit
2. Winpython
3. swig
4. cmake(gui)
5. Qt (or any other development kit with c/c++ compilors)

How to compile:
1 Windows
2 Install Qt Creator. Set Build & Run in option.
Kits -? compiler + CMake Tool.
3 Run CMake.gui and make sure swig.exe(used to generate python binding) and configures are done.
May have bug with cmake if using 3.80 or higher. Boost is not necessary.
=============
Change
SWIG_ADD_MODULE(ftdi1 python ftdi1.i)
into 
if (${CMAKE_VERSION} VERSION_LESS "3.8.0")
	SWIG_ADD_MODULE(ftdi1 python ftdi1.i)
else()
	SWIG_ADD_LIBRARY(ftdi1
	LANGUAGE python
	SOURCES ftdi1.i)
endif()
===========

How to make:
Go to build directory and run "mingw32-make"

Put all .dll files and ftdi1.py, _ftdi1.pyd into winpython/python3.6/Lib/site-packages

Have trouble with 64 bit?
